WARNING: this script is a work in progress and it's just for reference.

## Description

This is a script I decided to write for personal use. 
It has two main features:

1) It reads a list of manga titles from an Excel file, fetches the titles data from two different popular websites using browser automation (Selenium for one, BeautifulSoup for the other) and then writes the data to the same Excel file.

2) It searches for a manga title from user input and shows links to buy from an italian store.\

The user is presented with a choice when the script is executed.

Some data is imported from a config file that is not tracked.
