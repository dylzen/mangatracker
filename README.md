WARNING: this script is a work in progress and it's just for reference.

## Description

This is a script I decided to write for personal use. 
It is divided into two sections:

A section where it reads a list of manga titles from an Excel file, fetches the titles data from two different popular websites using browser automation (Selenium/BeautifulSoup) and then writes the data to the same Excel file.\
A section where it searches for a manga title from user input and shows links to buy from an italian store.\

The user is presented with a choice when the script is executed.

Some data is imported from a config file that is not tracked.
