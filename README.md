WARNING: this script is a work in progress and it's just for reference.

## Description

This is a script I decided to write for personal use. 
It reads a list of manga titles from an Excel file, fetches the titles data from two different popular websites using browser automation and then writes the data in the same Excel file.

Some data is imported from a config file that is not tracked.
